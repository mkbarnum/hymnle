# Hymnle

This is a clone project of the popular word guessing game we all know and love. Made using React, Typescript, and Tailwind.

## Build and run

### Prerequisites for Windows OS:

1. Download Git Bash (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Download VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Create a GitHub account (https://github.com)
4. Install Node JS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### To Run Locally:

Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/mkbarnum/hymnle.git
$> cd hymnle
$> npm install
$> npm run start
```

A browser should open automatically to localhost:3000 and you'll see the app running there. 

### Making Changes:

In Visual Studio Code, open the hymnle folder. 

When you make changes while "npm run start" is running, localhost:3000 will automatically be updated with your changes.


When changes are tested locally and ready to be saved, you will need to push them to this GitHub repo. 

```bash
$> git add [the files that you changed]
$> git commit -m "[message about what your changes are]"
$> git push
```

### How can I add usage tracking?

This repository includes support for Google Analytics or [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io), but, by default, this is disabled.

To enable Google Analytics:

- Create a Google Analytics 4 property and obtain the measurement ID (of the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX`

Keep in mind that your region might have legislation about obtaining a user's consent before enabling trackers. This is up to downstream repos to implement.

To enable Plausible Analytics:

- Create a new website with Plausible Analytics with a given domain, e.g. `example.app`
- In [.env](.env), add `REACT_APP_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=example.app`
